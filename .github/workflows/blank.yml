# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      #- uses: actions/checkout@v4
